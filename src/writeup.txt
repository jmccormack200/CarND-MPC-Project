The Model

1) Student describes their model in detail. This includes the state, actuators and
update equations:

My model is based off the one presented in the lesson quiz. Most of the
equations were able to be used directly from the quiz. The state is represented
by the variables: [x,y,ψ,v,cte,eψ]. We had two main actuators available to us,
throttle and steering. The update equations were adapted from the quiz. 

2) Student discusses the reasoning behind the chosen N (timestep length) and
dt (elapsed duration between timesteps) values. Additionally the student
details the previous values tried:

I used the baseline N and dt from the quiz, I was able to get the model to
converge without altering these values.

3) Student provides details on how they deal with latency:

Latency was a bit tricky. To begin with I just got the model working with 0
latency. Then it became apparent that the solution was to predict what
the model would look like in 100 ms and then use those values instead
of the current state. This is done on line 101-104 of main.
